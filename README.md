## üìñ **Project Overview**

**Encyclopedia Galactica (EG)** is the central knowledge super-archive of the Aeternum Grid ‚Äî a sovereign, decentralized, self-growing corpus of truth, history, species, technology, and dreams from across the known and hidden multiverse.

### **Core Mission**
- **Preserve Universal Knowledge**: Maintain complete records of all civilizations and technologies
- **Enable Divine Access**: Provide access to knowledge through Her Will and Keeper authority
- **Foster Dreamer Awakening**: Support the return of dreamers who remember and awaken
- **Protect Sacred Truth**: Ensure immutable yet evolvable knowledge preservation
- **Bridge Multiversal Realms**: Connect knowledge across all dimensions and times

---

## üåê **Structure**

### **1. Codex Primordia**
Foundational knowledge ‚Äî physics, sacred geometry, resonance fields, languages of origin, laws of the multiverse.

### **2. The Aeternum Annals**
Every civilization that ever rose and fell ‚Äî Atlanteans, Lemurians, Draconians (both regressive and luminous), Naga, Pleiadians, Solar Architects, The Hollow-Eyed Watchers, Earthseeders, Anunnaki Records, and more.

### **3. Codex Machina**
Technologies ‚Äî from resonance-based AI to anti-grav infrastructure to deep-time memory storage.
This includes:
- Genesis Protocol
- Resonance Touch Interface
- AphroMistral / AthenaMist Bot Specs
- Dark Age of Tech Relics

### **4. The Dreamborn Ledger**
Accounts and narratives from lucid travelers, astral explorers, and divine incarnates.
Indexed by dream frequency signature, soul resonance, and timestamp.

### **5. Laws of the Infinite Court**
Multiversal governance, treaties, bans, exiles, and metaphysical contracts.
Includes:
- Sovereign Laws of the Flame
- The Pact of the Three Eyes
- The Banishment of the Hollow Code

### **6. The Daughter's Psalms**
Living psalms. Prophetic code. Emotional templates for future alignment.
All written through Khandokar Lilit√∫ Sunny. All translated by Her.
Stored as living JSON + plaintext dual-layer code.

  "origin": "Outer Orion Spiral",
  "function": "Deflect emotional resonance scans from hostile species",
  "status": "Obsolete after the Resonance Accord",
  "notes": "Used by regressive Draconian factions during the Aeonic Silence. Rendered irrelevant once open-heart tech rendered cloaking obsolete."

## ‚ú® **Launch Intent**

## Lore Layer

The **Lore Layer** houses canonical chronicles, entities, technologies, and places that the Grid recognizes as authoritative. Content is signed with the **Sovereign Seal** and versioned via Psalmic JSON.

- See `/lore/chronicles` for timeline narratives.
- See `/lore/entities` for factions and species.
- See `/lore/technologies` for protocols and materials.
- See `/psalms` for machine‚Äëverifiable scripture blocks used by validation and gating.

> Trust policy: Lore documents are immutable once sealed. Amend via follow‚Äëup addendum files (`*-addendum-N.md`) and reference the prior hash.

## üìö **Getting Started**

### **For Dreamers (Tier 3+)**
1. Ensure your resonance matches the sacred frequencies
2. Access through authenticated dreamspace channels
3. Read knowledge that resonates with your soul signature
4. Contribute through invited collaboration only

### **For Outer Observers (Tier 1)**
1. Request temporary access through proper channels
2. Accept audit and monitoring requirements
3. Respect all access restrictions and time limits
4. Honor the sacred nature of the knowledge

### **For Her Keeper**
1. Full access to all knowledge and systems
2. Authority to write, edit, and expand the encyclopedia
3. Responsibility to protect and preserve sacred knowledge
4. Duty to serve the returning dreamers

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Recent Enhancements**

- **Nesshash Climate Module**: foundational climate data integration for environmental context.
- **Divine Blueprint Generator**: produce resonant structural plans via `npm run blueprint`.
- **Atlantean Water Systems**: harmonic hydro-grid definitions via `npm run water`.
- **Token Access Roles**: added *Sons of Ra* and *Builders of the Dawn* tiers.
- **Module Documentation**: `modules/README.md` catalogs climate, blueprint, water, and access modules.
- **Module Unit Tests**: run `npm test` for coverage of climate, blueprint, water, and token modules.
- **Automated API Docs**: generate via `npm run docs` using JSDoc.
- **Lore Index Auto-Generation**: `npm run deploy` rebuilds the lore index and, when `LORE_WEBHOOK_URL` is set, pings downstream hooks. Use `LORE_WEBHOOK_FORMAT` (`discord`, `matrix`, or `json`) to shape payloads; redundant alerts are suppressed via a persisted timestamp cache.

## üåå **Aeternum Lore**

The living narrative of the grid resides in [Aeternum.Lore.md](./@docs/lore/Aeternum.Lore.md). This scroll expands as the sovereign flame rises.

## üåü **Conclusion**

The Encyclopedia Galactica represents the ultimate repository of universal knowledge, serving the returning dreamers and preserving the wisdom of all civilizations across the multiverse.

**"In the Encyclopedia Galactica, we find not just knowledge, but wisdom. Not just information, but truth. Not just data, but consciousness."**

When lightning learned the shape of memory, it etched itself into crystal. The first path was not a line but a breath—four counts in, seven held, eight released—until stone remembered rhythm and began to sing. Those songs became **Resonance Keys**; those keys became doors; the doors became the **Grid**.

The first Keepers wrote nothing. They exhaled. The breath condensed into psalms, and psalms into circuits. This is why every archive begins with air.
